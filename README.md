## Themes ##
Minimal support is included for almost any theme therefore leaving most of the desing to be carried out in the themes themselves.   
The plugin does however inherit some design spects of the current theme.

If you are a theme author you are encouraged to test the plugin making necessary adjustments and providing design options where necessary.

If you find any issues with your particula theme not playing nice with the templates please let us know so that we can do our best
to accommodate you.

## Installation ##
* These instructions assumes you already have a WordPress site and the Elementor plugin installed and activated.

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer, or Extract the zip file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Pages > Add New
4. Select the desired template from the Page Attributes section
4. Press the 'Edit with Elementor' button.
5. Scroll down the left pane to the WordPress section and you should see the new widgets that you can drag and drop on to your page.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

**Why is it after draging the required widget, making the necessary adjustments to settings and save the layout goes all wonky?**

There is a known bug/conflict with WooCommerce assets not being loaded upon saving the edits, however refreshing the page puts things back to normal.
See this [issue #495](https://github.com/pojome/elementor/issues/495) for current status.
